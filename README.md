# ♻️ Intel Sustainability SQL Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes Intel's 2024 device repurposing program to uncover how different device types, ages, and regions contribute to energy savings and CO₂ reduction.

The goal: Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to optimize Intel's sustainability efforts.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Over **600,000** devices repurposed
- **Older devices** save the most energy and CO₂ per unit
- **Asia** yields the highest CO₂ savings due to carbon intensity
- Recommended: Prioritize **older devices in high-impact regions**

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL (joins, CTEs, CASE, GROUP BY, aggregate functions)
- Intel dataset via Global Tech Accelerator (mock data)

---

## 🔍 SQL Files

- `01_joining_data.sql`: Combined device and impact tables
- `02_device_age_bucket.sql`: Categorized devices by age
- `03_summary_insights.sql`: Total energy and CO₂ savings
- `04_device_type_analysis.sql`: Laptop vs Desktop impact
- `05_region_analysis.sql`: Impact across global regions
